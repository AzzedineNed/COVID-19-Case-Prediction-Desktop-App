# COVID-19-Case-Prediction-Desktop-App
Welcome to the "COVID-19 Case Prediction Desktop App" repository! This project is dedicated to the development of a powerful desktop application for predicting COVID-19 cases using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging the capabilities of MATLAB, including transfer learning with the ResNet-50 model, the Deep Learning Toolbox, and the MATLAB App Designer, this application empowers users with the ability to make informed decisions based on data-driven predictions.

# Key Features:

# Predictive Power:
Harness the potential of deep learning and transfer learning with the ResNet-50 model to make accurate COVID-19 case predictions.

# User-Friendly Interface:
Enjoy a seamless user experience through the MATLAB App Designer, which provides an intuitive and visually appealing desktop application.

# Real-Time Data:
Access up-to-date COVID-19 data to ensure that predictions are based on the latest information.

# Interactive Visualization:
Explore data trends and predictions through interactive charts and visualizations.
